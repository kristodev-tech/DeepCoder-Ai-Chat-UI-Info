# Welcome to DeepCoder AI Chat UI

Hi there! 👋 I'm Kristopher Sorensen, the developer of **DeepCoder AI** — a powerful, self-hosted AI chat UI built to deliver the performance, flexibility, and control I always wanted from an AI assistant.

This project is the result of countless hours of coding, debugging, and refining. My goal was to create a full-featured, professional chat interface that rivals major platforms like ChatGPT, but with full local control and support for **Ollama-compatible models**, including quantized variants like `q4_0`.
